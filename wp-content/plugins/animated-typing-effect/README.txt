Create an animated typing effect that allows words to be 'typed out' on to a post or page.

== Description ==

Typing Effect allows you to generate a shortcode that will 'type out' words on to a page or post, in a widget or directly in a theme or template file. The plugin is based on the Typed.js typing animation script by Matt Boldt.

Simply add your words or sentences, click 'Generate Shortcode' and copy and paste the shortcode into a page, post or text widget.

You can also configure settings such as how quickly the typing effect takes place, delays before starting or backspacing, set the animation to loop repeatedly or randomise the order your words or sentences are typed out and deleted.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the animated-typing-effect folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the Typing Effect plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Generate a shortcode by going to Typing Effect on the main menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Can I use HTML in the animation?

Yes, you can enter HTML in the rows before generating a shortcode. You can also wrap the shortcode itself in HTML tags.

Can I edit the settings of the animation?

You can change a variety of settings such as the speed that the text is typed out, a delay before the animation begins, the speed at which the text is backspaced (deleted) and a delay before the backspacing begins. Ticking the 'Loop' box will mean the animation continues to repeat over and over. Entering a number in the 'Loop count' box will define how many times it will repeat - e.g. entering '3â€™ would type out and then backspace the text 3 times.

Can I preview my animation?

Yes, when you click 'Generate Shortcode', a preview will automatically be generated.
